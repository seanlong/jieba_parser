jieba_parser
============

PostgreSQL FTS parser extension based on Jieba

This parser extension is derived from http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/test-parser.html and https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba.

As the C++ version seems buggy at the moment, the original Python version was chosen instead.
